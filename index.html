    On your day6 branch, create a basic HTML mockup with a button, a div with some height and background color, and an h1 with some text
    Create event listeners for each:
    For the button, alert the user with a message when they click it.
    For the div, change the color of the background when their mouse goes into the div.
    For the h1, change the color of the text the user releases any key.
    Not Tough Enough? Try redirecting the user's browser to facebook when the click anywhere on the page.
